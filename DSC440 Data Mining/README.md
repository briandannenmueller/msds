# DSC 440 Data Mining

## Projects

### Project 1: Frequent itemset mining

Implementing the Apriori and FP-growth algorithms.

Optimization of Apriori and comparison of  performance between Apriori and FP-growth Algorithms is also included.

### Project 2: (final project) Text Classification performance boosting by improved Easy Data Augmentation

Collaborated with another student Xusheng.

In this project, we exploit the benefits of data augmen- tation working on a text classification problem. We im- proved an existing data augmentation algorithm which called easy data augmentation (EDA) to allow it to gen- erate number of augmentation and percent of changed words automatically. Additionally, we reduce the risk of sentence meaning changed by doing operation drop- ping with some probabilities depending on the length of the sentences. Furthermore, we experimentally eval- uate the performance gain by running three advanced deep learning models TextCNN, Bidirectional LSTM and Bert Transformer on Kaggle Toxic Comments Clas- sification Challenge. We found that the improved version of EDA can boost performance on each of the three deep leaning models.
