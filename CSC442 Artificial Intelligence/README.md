## Projects

### Project1: Game Playing

For practicing adversarial search algorithm: min-max. Designed and developed of Mancala game playing program with four modes: person-vs-person, person-vs-random, person-vs-min-max, person-vs-minmax(with alpha beta pruning to make the algorithm faster).

### Project 2: Automated Reasoning

Implemented an automated reasoning system with two inference methods: Model Checking and Resolution. Optimizations include parse tree of CNF, and parser of  plain text to logical formulas.

The structure of this project is:

- Representation
- Basic Model Checking
- Advanced Propositional Inference
- Tree-like Data Structures for Reasoning

### Project 3: **Uncertain Inference**

In this project, I implemented Bayesian networks to deal with uncertain knowledge. The project includes:

- A XMLBIF parser to read standard BN structure

- Exact Inference algorithm

- Approximation inference algorithm with Rejection Sampling

  Evaluation of different algorithms is also included.

### Project 4: Machine Learning

In this method, we explore applications of the gradient descent method to training logistic regression models and multilayer perceptrons.
